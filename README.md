# LP-2-Assignments
List of LP2 assignments

All 3 algorithms have more or less the SAME boiler plate code.Implemented in python, the 3 algos perform the same 3 steps which are

Step 1. We find the current node.(Initially when frontier list is empty it is start node itself).
Step 2. We expand the frontier node children, and update the gtentative score.If gtentative<g then we update gtable.
Step 3.Remove current node from frontier list, and add it to the closed list.
